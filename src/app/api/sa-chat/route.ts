const TINES_CONTEXT = `== YOUR COMPANY CONTEXT ==
Company: Tines
Description: Tines is the leading no-code security automation platform. It enables security teams to automate any workflow — from alert triage to incident response to compliance — without writing code and with no per-action pricing.
Products/Services:
- Tines Stories: Visual, no-code workflow builder for security automation
- Tines Cases: Built-in case management for security teams
- Tines Pages: Custom forms and portals for intake, approvals, and self-service
- AI Actions: LLM-powered steps integrated natively into workflows
- Tines API: Full REST API for programmatic workflow management
Key Differentiators: Only security automation platform with true no-code (not low-code), no per-action pricing (unlimited runs), vendor-agnostic integrations (works with any API), SOC2 Type II certified, used by top security teams at Snowflake, Canva, Databricks, Mars, McKesson.
Target Industries: Financial Services, Healthcare, Technology, Government/Defense, Critical Infrastructure
ICP: Enterprises (1000+ employees) with mature security teams, SIEM/EDR/ITSM tool stacks, and manual triage or response processes
Competitors: Splunk SOAR (complex, requires scripting), Palo Alto XSOAR (expensive, vendor lock-in), Torq (newer, less proven), Swimlane (complex low-code), ServiceNow SecOps (heavy IT overhead)
Common Objections: "We already have a SOAR" → Tines replaces legacy SOAR with true no-code and unlimited runs. "Our team can script it" → No-code means non-engineers can build and maintain, reducing key-person risk. "We're evaluating ServiceNow" → Tines is purpose-built for security, not a bolt-on to ITSM.
